**About the data placed in Australia**

The flight heights are real. The points were moved to other location but the dataset was not changed in other way (e.g. not rescaled, transformed etc.).
The GPS altitude values were calculated using DEM-S dataset by Geoscience Australia:

support dataset - fictional airborne monitoring in Ranger Uranium Mine area:

"The Ranger Uranium Mine is a uranium mine in the Northern Territory of Australia. It is surrounded by, but separate from Kakadu National Park, 230 km east of Darwin. The orebody was discovered in late 1969, and the mine commenced operation in 1980, reaching full production of uranium oxide in 1981. It is operated by Energy Resources of Australia, a 68% subsidiary of Rio Tinto Group. Uranium mined at Ranger is sold for use in nuclear power stations in Asia, Europe and North America."

The flight path is real, but was moved to different location, date and time was changed (date set to 2001-04-01).

This package contains support data for flight proposed "Simulated flight path generator" in standard formats (CSV, GeoPackage).

Fictional airborne monitoring in Valley of Fire State Park area:

"Valley of Fire State Park is a public recreation and nature preservation area covering nearly 46,000 acres (19,000 ha) located 16 miles (26 km) south of Overton, Nevada.[3] The state park derives its name from red sandstone formations, the Aztec Sandstone, which formed from shifting sand dunes 150 million years ago.[4] These features, which are the centerpiece of the park's attractions, often appear to be on fire when reflecting the sun's rays.[5] It is Nevada's oldest state park, as commemorated with Nevada Historical Marker #150.[6] It was designated as a National Natural Landmark in 1968.[7]

Valley of Fire is located 50 miles (80 km) northeast of Las Vegas, at an elevation between 1,320–3,009 feet (402–917 m).[4] It abuts the Lake Mead National Recreation Area on the east at the Virgin River confluence. It lies in a 4 by 6 mi (6.4 by 9.7 km) basin."
