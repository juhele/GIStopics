*Introduction*

The territorial network of thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD) is a part of the Czech Radiation Monitoring Network. Consists of 180 points with dosimeters - some outdoors, some in buildings.

In case of a normal radiation situation, the measurements are performed quarterly, in case of a radiation accident more often. The dosimeters are gradually collected by car and transported to the lab to get the results.
